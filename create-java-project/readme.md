1. Make the script executable on every new machine:

```bash
chmod +x create-java-project.sh
```

2. Run the script with the full path to the project directory:
```bash
./create-java-project.sh /full/path/to/your/new-java-project
```
3. Open in VS Code:
```bash
code /full/path/to/your/new-java-project
```
4. Happy Hunting!
